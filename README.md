# http_server

This is a lightweight HTTP server which I created with C.
I built this to learn more about C and network programming while diving deeper into how the HTTP protocol works.

Do not use this HTTP server for anything serious as it is not secure and is not optimized for performance either.
I tried my best doing the optimizations that I could, however I am at this time a beginner with C and this program probably suffers bad memory management.
